# Git Gud Guidelines
A public space for sharing tips and lessons learned on your coding journey.

- Playful, yet serious.
- Be respectful and helpful.

This is a sort of playground, a place for my webinar attendees to safely practice their first attempt at contributing to a pulic repository. Or, for experienced attendees to quickly share their wisdom with others in the moment.

Did you just attend a webinar or similar event with Christopher? Or... are you in it right now?
Maybe he introduced the idea of forking a repo, creating a branch, making some changes, and submitting a pull request (PR)? Here is your place to give it a try!
